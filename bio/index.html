      <h2>About Your Therapist</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Allison Kayyem, MSW</h3>
        <p>
          Allison Kayyem is a licensed professional counselor with over 4 years of
          experience helping adults navigate anxiety, depression, life transitions, and
          relationship challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allison believes that therapy should be collaborative, compassionate, and
          grounded in your unique story. Their approach is integrative, drawing from
          cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, and person-centered
          techniques.

        <h3>Therapeutic Approach</h3>
        <p>
          In sessions, Allison focuses on creating a space where you feel heard and
          understood. Together, you’ll explore patterns, identify strengths, and develop
          practical tools for navigating daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therapy is not one-size-fits-all; Alex will work with you to tailor the pace,
          focus, and style to your needs and comfort level.
