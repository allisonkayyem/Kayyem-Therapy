      <h2>Welcome to Kayyem Therapy</h2>
      <p>
        My approach is integrative and collaborative. Depending on your needs, I may draw from CBT, DBT, Trauma Informed Care, Gottman Method, Narrative work, and strengths-based interventions. Therapy is tailored to you—there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. I work with adults and couples who feel stuck in patterns they can’t quite untangle on their own. Therapy with me is collaborative, grounded, and focused on helping you understand yourself with more clarity and compassion. I’m a Licensed Social Worker who believes you are the expert on your own life. My role is to walk alongside you—helping identify patterns, explore what’s beneath the surface, and create space for meaningful change. I aim to offer a calm, nonjudgmental environment where you don’t have to perform or have it all figured out. I am a Licensed Social Worker (LSW) in the state of Colorado and practice under clinical supervision as required by state law.
